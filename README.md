## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
- Filter active and inactive extensions
- Remove extensions from the list
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I learned
Working on the Chrome Extension UI project was a great learning experience that helped me improve not just my frontend skills but also how I think about browser behavior, user interaction, and code structure. Some of the key things I learned and practiced include:

ðŸ§  Local Storage: I learned how to persist data using localStorage, which allows the extension to remember user input or changes even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

```js
localStorage.setItem('key', value);
const savedData = localStorage.getItem('key');
```

âš¡ DOMContentLoaded: I learned the importance of waiting for the DOM to be fully loaded before accessing or manipulating elements to avoid errors.

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // Safe to access DOM elements here
});
```

ðŸŽ¯ Event Targeting & closest(): I worked a lot with event.target and element.closest() to precisely detect user interactions and respond accordingly â€” especially useful in nested or dynamically generated elements.

```js
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  const card = e.target.closest('.task-card');
  if (card) {
    card.classList.toggle('selected');
  }
});
```

ðŸ§© addEventListener Everywhere: I deeply understood how flexible and powerful addEventListener can be â€” not just for clicks, but also for form inputs, key presses, and more.

```js
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

ðŸŽ¨ Nested Styles & CSS Structure: I learned how to better organize CSS using class selectors and nesting ideas (visually, not using a preprocessor yet). I also saw how consistent class naming makes styling easier to maintain.

```css
.task-card {
  padding: 1rem;
  background-color: #fff;
}
.task-card .task-title {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

ðŸ—‚ HTML Best Practices: I focused on using the right HTML tags (like <button> instead of clickable <div>s), properly labeling elements, and maintaining semantic structure for clarity and accessibility.

```html
<form id="task-form">
  <label for="task-title">Title</label>
  <input type="text" id="task-title" name="task-title" />
  <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
</form>
```

âœ… Clean Git Commits: I started writing clearer, more intentional commit messages â€” using the present tense and making each commit focused on a specific change.
âœ… Improve task card rendering on reload
ðŸ”§ Fix bug with localStorage data overwrite
ðŸŽ¨ Refactor CSS for card spacing

### Continued development

I want to focus more on JS project then move on to js framework

### Useful resources

- I used chatgpt and github copilot
